# griddler-solver
A comprehensive library for solving griddlers.  Just create an array of Items for the rows and columns.  Pass these into Logic.Run() which will return the Points and Dots for drawing/analysing.

Includes unit testing to assist in the development.  These should be run after any changes to the logic.

Features
* Solves using the same techniques used to solve by hand
* Supports two colour (Green/Black) griddlers

Notes
* The client side is just to assist in developing the logic.

Griddlers have been collected from these places:
* https://nonogramskatana.wordpress.com/
* Hanjie Books Issues 65 & 113
* Telegraph Newspapers
